## Synopsis

The Health Check is an online survey designed as a tool for leaders of professional services organizations to assess their team's consulting practices. It's less than 50 questions, phrased as agree-disagree statements, and culminates by calculating and displaying scores across 6 question topics.

## Code Example

The Javascript reads questions and metadata from files stored in /data, then writes questions to the screen using the existing HTML structure as a template.
