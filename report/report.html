		</div>
		<p>Each component is comprised of a number of attributes; each component is described here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Services Business Strategy:</strong> Evaluates the degree to which the services business strategy is aligned with the corporate strategy (in an embedded consulting business) and the strategies of key business partners such as sales, marketing, finance, and product management.</li>
			<li><strong>Services Go To Market Strategy:</strong> The Go To Market (GTM) Strategy evaluation looks at the degree to which there is a plan for how sales will be conducted and to whom. We look at the marketing plan, sales model, and sales team, among other things.</li>
			<li><strong>Services Portfolio:</strong> The Services Portfolio evaluation assesses the degree to which clear, easy to sell services offerings have been developed. We look at the alignment of the offerings to the services team's skills and capabilities, the market need, and the sell-ability of each.</li>
			<li><strong>Repeatable Delivery Framework:</strong> The Repeatable Delivery Framework assessment reviews the tools, templates, and processes that have been developed for each service offering in the services portfolio and how they are used within services to improve delivery quality and scalability, new hire and partner onboarding, and even the sales process.</li>
			<li><strong>The Team:</strong> The Team assessment looks at the alignment of skills represented on the team and the stated mission of the services department, as well as the needs expressed by the market. Additionally, we assess how well services management communicates with, empowers, and invests in the team.</li>
			<li><strong>Business Operations and Financial Management:</strong>The Business Operations and Financial Management assessment reviews whether the KPIs, practice opeations, and financial tools and processes are in support of the services business' core purpose and goals.</li>

	<h2>Sophity Services Success Health Check - Introduction</h2>
	<p>Sophity presented a series of statements in the form of a survey and asked the participant to rate the degree to which s/he agreed with each statement. The questions were framed such that the more you agreed with the statement in context with the reality of your current business, the higher the score for your response.<br><br>We took the average of the scores for all questions to calculate the category-level scores. We then took the average of the 6 category scores to calculate the total score for your business.<br><br>The following table shows how the letter grades were derived:</p>
	<table id="grade-scale">

				<th>4.4-4.7</th>
				<th>4.7-5.0</th>
